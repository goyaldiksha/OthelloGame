# OthelloGame
Othello is a multiplayer board game based on popular game Reversi. It is played upon an 8 x 8 squared board. Accompanying the board, there should be 64 pieces each of which is dark on one side and light on the other. In this project we input the total number of moves (n) to be executed which should always be an even number less than equal to 64 and we input  (x,y) coordinates for each player where we want to make a move, if the move is feasible then required changes are made on the board. If there are no further moves possible or total number of moves executes are equal to n then the result is displayed.
